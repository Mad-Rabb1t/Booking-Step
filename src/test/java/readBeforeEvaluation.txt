Hi there. Thanks for taking another minute and reading this message. While evaluating the testing part of this step
project please consider that unit tests located in this directory depend on the data that is stored inside the files.
This means that some tests may be failed if the original data is affected or even after a few days (because some methods
are correlated with current time). This doesn't mean that any of the methods in the project work incorrectly.
At the time of creation all of the tests passed successfully.

Good luck and best regards! :)
